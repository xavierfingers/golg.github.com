                <h2>What is Gemini CLI?</h2>
                <p>The Gemini CLI is a powerful, context-aware command-line interface that brings the power of Google's Gemini models directly to your terminal. It's designed to streamline your workflow, automate tasks, and provide intelligent assistance for a wide range of software engineering and development tasks. Unlike traditional CLIs, Gemini CLI can understand natural language, reason about your codebase, and even execute commands on your behalf.</p>

                <h2>Getting Started</h2>
                <p>Getting started with Gemini CLI is straightforward. Once installed, you can initiate a session in your project directory. The CLI will immediately get familiarized with your project's context and file structure.</p>
                <pre><code class="language-bash">gemini init</code></pre>

                <h2>Use Cases</h2>
                <h3>1. Code Refactoring</h3>
                <p>You can ask Gemini to refactor your code. For example, you can ask it to convert a function from using `Promise` to `async/await` syntax.</p>
                <pre><code class="language-javascript">// Old code
function getData() {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => resolve(data))
      .catch(error => reject(error));
  });
}</code></pre>
                <p>You can simply ask: "Refactor the `getData` function to use async/await."</p>
                <pre><code class="language-javascript">// New code
async function getData() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
    const data = await response.json();
    return data;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
}</code></pre>
                <h3>2. Writing Tests</h3>
                <p>Gemini can help you write unit tests for your code. Just point it to a file and ask it to write tests for a specific function.</p>
                <pre><code class="language-bash">gemini test src/utils.js --for-function "calculateTotal"</code></pre>
                <h3>3. Debugging</h3>
                <p>Stuck on a bug? Describe the problem to Gemini, and it can help you find the root cause by analyzing your code and suggesting potential fixes.</p>
